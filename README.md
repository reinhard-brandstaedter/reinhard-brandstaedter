Besides my real work, I'm an engineer. I like trying new stuff and automating things that I do not like to do twice or repeatedly. As I'm generally a perfectionist (or at least try to be) I hate it when things do not work to my liking. Then I either try fixing it, or discard it.

On my github profile you will find various things, old an new, work-related or private! Everything I do I like to share! I'm taking feedback but always expect a respecting exchange/give and take.
